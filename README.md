# Time Follows Mouse

This is a nifty tool for macOS that adds time to the bottom right of the cursor that will be very useful especially when you are using multiple monitors

### Steps to install
Just download the zip file from releases and then drag and drop the app file to your applications folder and then open it (If it shows some error try to right click the app and then open)

### Functionality
As soon as you open the app, it will add a small time overlay below the mouse cursor

### Current Roadmap
I will be adding customisation options like color, background, font and placement.


### Tip
Add the app to your login items in the settings to auto open the app everytime you turn your computer on
